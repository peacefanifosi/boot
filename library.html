                            to the nation and its citizens. The intention is to provide value added library services that
                             can meet educational aspirations of the users which can nurture their creativity, innovation

                    <p>
                        It is an honour of great dimension to be part of this propitious development
                         coming up at a time the Olusegun Oke Library is more concerned about rejuvenating,
                          strengthening and revitalizing its services to meet the information needs and yearning
                           of the teeming users. The reason is because, the world has moved from the information
                            revolution age, to the knowledge economy era; suffice to say that, whatever one knows
                             will be under one’s control, meaning that, an individual could remain a slave to what
                              he does not know. Sequel to this, if one is not informed, one could be deformed. 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                      In line with the foregoing, the academic library remains the best organ in the university that
                       can provide information that is complementary to teaching, learning and research activities of
                        the users. Equally, the library as the Commonwealth of learning, and the symbol of our universal
                         information community has the primary role of providing information service to support the educational,
                          recreational, cultural, economic and technological needs of the academic community. It is
                           safe to say that, the more one accesses library resources the better the knowledge acquired.
                            As an extension of the classroom, library space needs to embody new pedagogies, including
                             collaborative and interactive learning modalities. Significantly, the library must serve
                              as the principal learning centre on the campus of the Peace University of Medical Sciences,
                              Osogbo, where one can truly experience and benefit from the centrality of an institution’s
                               intellectual work/property and the unlimited avalanche of the world of information.
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                      According to Gregorian (1998) <br>
                      ‘Libraries are not only repositories of past human endeavour, they are instruments of
                       civilization. They provide tools for learning, a laboratory of human aspiration, a 
                       window to the future. They are a source of self-renewal, intellectual growth', and
                        hope. In this land and everywhere on earth, they are a medium of progress, autonomy,
                         empowerment, independence and self-determination. They have always provided, and
                          would always provide, place and space for imaginative re-creation for imaginative
                           rebirth.’
                    </p><br>
                    <p>
                      At this juncture, the business of libraries can now be understood as one key component
                       of a rapidly evolving, almost wholly transformed environment in which information is
                        proliferating at heretofore unimagined rates. It is therefore, an opportunity to be
                         part of this ingenuity and inspiration coming from the LICT. The opportunity will
                          help project the image of the Olusegun Oke Library and bring global visibility to 
                          PUMS in the Medical world.
